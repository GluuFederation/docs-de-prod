## On which network is Gluu Server DE running?

For the single-host example, `run_all.sh` script executes the `docker-compose up -d` command, where docker-compose creates a custom bridge network based on the name of your current directory. So, for example, the network would be named `dockergluuserver_bridge`. You can assign a custom network in the `docker-compose.yaml`. Please see [the Docker-compose official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/#specify-custom-networks) for further information.

All other containers in the docker-compose file are connected to that same network as well. The only container not included in the `docker-compose.yaml` file is the `config-init`. We left them disconnected, as `config-init` shouldn't be daemonized to avoid rerunning the command when the container is restarted.
As can be seen in the following `docker run` command, it connects to the same network as Consul with the `--network container:consul` option.

    docker run --rm \
        --network container:consul \
        -e GLUU_CONFIG_ADAPTER=consul \
        -e GLUU_CONSUL_HOST=consul \
        gluufederation/config-init:3.1.4_dev \
        generate \
        --ldap-type "${GLUU_LDAP_TYPE}" \
        --domain $domain \
        --admin-pw $adminPw \
        --org-name "$orgName" \
        --email $email \
        --country-code $countryCode \
        --state $state \
        --city $city

For the multi-host example, we're using native Docker Swarm `overlay` network, but slightly customized to allow connecting any container outside of the network. See the [Networking](./example.md#Networking) section for a multi-host example.
